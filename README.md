# Disk-Check

## Overview
`disk-check` is a simple yet powerful **Bash script** that monitors your systemâ€™s disk usage.  
It prints the **current date and time**, displays a summary of all mounted file systems, and checks if any partition is above a configurable threshold (default: 80%).

If any partition exceeds the threshold, the script warns the user with  
`"Disk space running low check system"`.  
Otherwise, it reports `"Disk space is healthy."`.

All results are saved to an output file named **`disk_report.txt`** for reference or logging.

---

##  Features
- Displays **current date and time** in the report header.
- Shows **human-readable disk usage** (`df -h`).
- Automatically checks for **high disk usage** above a defined threshold (default 80%).
- Prints a **clear status message** for system health.
- **Logs** the full report into `disk_report.txt`.
- Easy to configure, lightweight, and requires no dependencies.

---

## Requirements
- Linux or macOS system with **Bash** (version 4+ recommended)
- Standard core utilities: `df`, `awk`, `date`, and `tee`

No external packages or root privileges are required.
